# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis provide our friend Louise with information on how other fundraising campaigns ended up, to give her the best chance of starting a campaign that would reach its funding goal. Using the data provided on past and current campaigns, we would hopefully be able to uncover trends that would give her a chance to run a successful campaign.
## Analysis and Challenges
 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Our analysis began by creating a PivotTable to aggregate and filter the data down to a month by month look at theater projects split by their outcome.

By doing this, we were able to get a simple look at the timeline of projects Louise was interested in and we were able to easily create a graph that made the data more visually accessible. One difficulty was getting the PivotTable set up correctly to show the info we wanted. However, once that was fixed, it was smooth sailing.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The Outcomes Based on Goals table and graph allowed us to get more information on this data by looking at how campaigns fared depending on the monetary size of the goal being sought. This was an important addition because it gave us more insight into other fields of the data set. It's important to know how the size of the goal we're trying to hit will impact the likelihood of the money being raised and this view shows that clearly.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The main challenge was just getting the data set up correctly to put together the PivotTable's or graphs. After playing around with the different views it was pretty straightforward. Other potential challenges could have been just making sure that the entire table was pulled when the PivotTable was created, it's easy to forget about a filter that would throw off the final product.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

Using this visual, we were able to to see that theater campaigns had a higher success rate than fail rate in every month which was interesting info for Louise. We also saw that the success rate jumped about halfway through the year, specifically May and June, and showed us that around that time period would be the best time to start the campaign.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

This data shows us that as the goal increases, the chance of the campaign being successful drops. That flips when the goal is between $35,000 and $44,999 but the number of campaigns in those bucket is so small that it's statistically insignificant. We learned that Louise's best odds to have her project funded is to keep her goal under $5,000

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

One limitation might be the size. Though there's a lot of campaigns in the dataset, our "Outcomes Based on Goals" visual gets thrown off by the lack of projects in some buckets. It looks like the campaign starter would have a good chance of getting funding when they cross the $35,000 goal but that's just a function of only having 6 campaigns in that bucket and 3 in the next. Another limitation could be not knowing how many of these campaigns were legitimate. Some of our outliers or small goal campaigns could be jokes that end up throwing off our data.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

We could use the Date Ended Conversion to look at how long successful campaigns were live before they were fully funded. If Louise started her campaign that might give us some insight on how on track she is to success. On top of that, we could dive deeper into the theater subcategories once we knew what kind of campaign Louise would be running. Using that and number of backers, we could find out the average donations and see if it'd be reasonable for Louise's goal. Staff Pick is a field we didn't use much. It'd be interesting to see the success rate of those picks and possibly let Louise know she has a better chance of success of she can get on their list.
